# Horiseon-challenge
## Refractor for SEO and Accessibility

In this challenge I refractored the existing Horiseon website to make it more accessible and to improve SEO.  I also utilized semanitc HTML for both future developers and browser usage.  I cleaned up redundancies, corrected the flow, and created comments to facilitate future updates. All changes were made without affecting the existing website.  Below is a timeline of all of the changes made and the stamp for the .git commits as I moved through the process.
